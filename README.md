## Model Use Guide
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

# Load the tokenizer and model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("adi2606/Menstrual-Health-Awareness-Chatbot")
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("adi2606/Menstrual-Health-Awareness-Chatbot")

# Function to generate a response from the chatbot
def generate_response(input_text):
    # Tokenize the input text
    inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

    # Generate the output (the response)
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs)

    # Decode the output back to text
    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return response

# Example usage
input_text = "What are the symptoms of PMS?"
response = generate_response(input_text)
print(response)
```

### Model Description

## Uses

### Direct Use

The model can be used to answer questions related to menstrual health. Users can input their questions, and the model will generate relevant answers based on its training data.

### Out-of-Scope Use

The model should not be used for medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations. It is designed for informational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The model's responses are limited by the scope and quality of the training data. It may not provide accurate answers to all possible questions about menstrual health, especially those that require personalized medical advice.

### Recommendations

Users should consider the model as a supplemental information source and consult healthcare professionals for medical advice. Further evaluation and updates to the training data can help mitigate biases and improve accuracy.
